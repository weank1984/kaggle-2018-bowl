# Automate nucleus detection
2018 data science bowl

## Background
By automating nucleus detection, can help unlock faster-from rare discorders to the common cold.

## Nuclei
Identifing the cell's nuclei is the starting for most analyses. Identifying nuclei allows reasearchers to identify each individual cell in a sample, and by measuring how cells react to various treatments, the researcher can unferstand the underlying biological processes at work.
